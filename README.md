# google-script-form
google app script for using form results to create custom doc and email

# Set Up
This simple script assumes plugs in to a form that has 4 entries: email, company name, client name, and a drop down option for "plan." The form can change, but so then will the script.

The script assumes you have G Suite of apps including Sheets, Drive, Docs, and Email.

The script also assumes there are templated versions of the Plans on the root Google Drive folder.
